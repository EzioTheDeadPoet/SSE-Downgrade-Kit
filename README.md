## Why does this repo exist?

On 11/11/2021, Bethesda released The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Anniversay Edition and updated the game from 1.5.97 to 1.6.xxx. This changed modding in such a way that would forever create a schism between the 1.5.xxx versions and 1.6.xxx versions. That means sometimes you want one and sometimes you want the other.

[Wabbajack](http://www.wabbajack.org/) is usually able to convert automatically convert between the versions with a bit of binary patching but these changes were so extreme that's not really the case. This repo serves to remedy that problem.

## How do I use this?

TBD

## Do you have permission to do this?

Good question! I have no idea. I'm just betting on the idea that Bethesda et al. isn't really going to care if host a few files from old versions of their game in order to support people buying and playing their games. This certainly isn't the most egregious use of vanilla files in the modding world. /shrug. Let me know if I need to take them down.

That said, all files in this repo should be considered copyrighted by Bethesda Game Studio unless otherwise mentioned.
